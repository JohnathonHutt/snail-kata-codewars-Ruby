a solution to the codewars kata snail in Ruby

My solution to the kata Snail on www.codewars.com

This solution is considerably more verbose than many of the others but it was the first 4 kyu kata I've solved so I'm reasonably happy with it. I am posting it here for github practice.

#the problem 

Snail Sort

Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
